    <div>
        <h2>How much will shipping and taxes cost?</h2>
        <p>Shipping and VATincluded!</p>
        <p>Every price you see is the final price for that item, worldwide shipping and VAT included.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>How long does shipping take?</h2>
        <p>Instead of having a bunch of items sitting in a warehouse, all items are produced when you order them. It takes 2 - 7 days for production and about 4 days for shipping, on average (but it mostly depends on what country you're shipping to).</p>
        <p>In short: items will reach most destinations in 1 - 2 weeks.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Are returns accepted?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, no. Each item is made custom for each order, so returns can't be accepted.</p>
